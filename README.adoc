= Pico Blink

This is an example project for the Raspberry Pi Pico that includes the SDK and does not require an installation of the SDK.
It uses Docker to build a build image that contains the SDK and openocd.

== Prerequisites

To use this you'll need at least the following things:

 * A https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/[Raspberry Pi Pico] to be programmed
 * (optional) A second https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/[Raspberry Pi Pico] running https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe[Picoprobe] to act as an SWD debug adapter.
 * A linux system (only Intel x64 tested)
 * A working docker installation


== Building the example

To build the example simply clone this repository and then run the `build.sh` script.

NOTE: Make sure that the `docker` command can be run without using sudo. If this does not work, then none of the follwing scripts will work.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/TerrySoba/pico_blink.git
cd pico_blink
./build.sh
----



After the build, the `build` directory will contain the built software.
You may now simply copy the `build/blink.uf2` file to Raspberry Pi Pico while in the bootloader.

A more elegant solution is to use a second Raspberry Pi Pico using the https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe[Picoprobe] firmware as an SWD debug adapter.
The wiring of the Picoprobe is described in the official documentation of the Raspberry Pi Pico.

When the Picoprobe is connected, the the `flash.sh` script may be used to flash the firmware.

[source,bash]
----
./flash.sh
----
